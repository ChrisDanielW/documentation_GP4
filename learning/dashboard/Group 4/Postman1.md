## Installation, Setup and Updates

<br>

 Postman can be downloaded for all major operating systems, including Mac, Linux, and Windows, as a native app (standalone application). Postman is also available as a chrome extension application, but it is preferable to install and use the native desktop app because the extension does not support all the features that the native app has.

### Downloading and installing the native Postman application on Windows

<br>

* Go to the link https://www.postman.com/downloads/ and click download for Mac or Windows or Linux based on your operating system.<br><br>

* For downloading the app for Windows, click on the download button and select the particular version. I opted for the 64-bit version. If you are using a 32-bit OS, you can choose the 32 bit, as shown in the above image.

* You can check the download progress on the bottom left if you are using the Chrome browser. Once the .exe file is downloaded, you need to install the application, as shown in the below image.<br><br>

### Downloading and installing the native Postman application on Linux (Ubuntu)

<br>

To install the latest version of the Postman desktop app, you need to install it through the Snap Store using the following commands via the terminal.
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install snapd
$ sudo snap install postman
```
Alternatively, you can download and install it from the Snap Store itself.
